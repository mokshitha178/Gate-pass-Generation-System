# Gate-pass-Generation-System
The Gate Pass Generation System is a web application designed to streamline the process of managing gate passes within an organization. This system allows individuals who need to enter or exit the premises to submit a gate pass request, which includes all necessary information and the purpose of their travel. 
The application features distinct interfaces for applicants and administrators. Applicants can fill out and submit their gate pass applications online. These applications are then reviewed by an administrator through a secure, password-protected admin panel. The administrator has the authority to approve or deny the requests. If approved, the system generates a PDF version of the gate pass, which the applicant can then access. This efficient and organized approach simplifies the gate pass management process, ensuring that all movements are properly documented and authorized.
